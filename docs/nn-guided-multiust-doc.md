# Neural Network-Guided AdaptiveMultiUST

## Overview

The Neural Network-Guided AdaptiveMultiUST is an innovative approach that combines the adaptability of a Universal Search Tree (UST) with the learning capabilities of a neural network. This implementation uses a neural network to guide the restructuring process of the UST, potentially improving its efficiency over time.

## How It Works

1. **Tree Structure**: The core of this implementation is an AdaptiveMultiUST, which is a tree-like structure where each node represents a point in multi-dimensional space.

2. **Neural Network**: A simple neural network (MLPRegressor from scikit-learn) is used to predict optimal connections for nodes in the tree.

3. **Dynamic Restructuring**: As the tree is used and restructured, it collects data on how nodes are connected. This data is used to train the neural network.

4. **Guided Optimization**: When restructuring is needed, the neural network predicts the optimal number of connections for each dimension of a node. The tree then adjusts its structure based on these predictions.

5. **Continuous Learning**: With each restructuring operation, new training data is generated, allowing the neural network to continuously improve its predictions.

## Key Components

- `NeuralGuidedMultiUST`: The main class that integrates the UST with the neural network.
- `_get_node_features`: Extracts features from a node for the neural network to use.
- `_restructure`: Uses the neural network's predictions to guide the restructuring process.

## Usage

The system is used by adding nodes to the tree and performing nearest neighbor searches. Over time, as more operations are performed and the tree is restructured, the neural network learns to guide these restructurings more effectively, potentially leading to a more efficient tree structure.

This approach combines the flexibility of the AdaptiveMultiUST with the learning capabilities of neural networks, aiming to create a self-improving data structure for efficient multi-dimensional searches.

## Visualization

To best visualize the Neural Network-Guided AdaptiveMultiUST, consider the following approaches:

1. **Tree Structure Visualization**: 
   - Use a force-directed graph layout to represent the UST structure.
   - Nodes can be colored based on their depth in the tree or the number of connections.
   - Edge thickness could represent the strength of connections.

2. **Neural Network Influence**:
   - Overlay heatmaps on the tree visualization to show areas where the neural network has had the most influence on restructuring.
   - Use animated transitions to show how the tree structure changes over time based on neural network predictions.

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Plot search time vs. number of operations to show how efficiency improves over time.
   - Create a parallel coordinates plot to visualize how different node features correlate with the neural network's connection predictions.

Example visualization code snippet using networkx and matplotlib:

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def visualize_ust(ust):
    G = nx.Graph()
    for node in ust.nodes.values():
        G.add_node(node.value)
        for child in node.children:
            G.add_edge(node.value, child.value)
    
    pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
    nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue', 
            node_size=500, font_size=10, arrows=True)
    plt.title("Neural Network-Guided AdaptiveMultiUST")
    plt.show()
```

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Adaptive Recommendation Systems**: 
   - In e-commerce platforms, the system can adapt to changing user preferences and product relationships.
   - The neural network can learn patterns in user behavior to guide the restructuring of product categories and relationships.

2. **Dynamic Network Routing**:
   - In large-scale computer networks, the system can optimize routing paths.
   - The neural network can predict traffic patterns and guide the restructuring of network topology for efficient data transfer.

3. **Adaptive Machine Learning Model Selection**:
   - In automated machine learning (AutoML) systems, the UST can represent a space of model architectures and hyperparameters.
   - The neural network can guide the search through this space, learning from previous model performances to suggest promising configurations.

4. **Evolving Knowledge Graphs**:
   - In knowledge management systems, the UST can represent complex relationships between concepts.
   - The neural network can learn from user interactions and new information to guide the restructuring of the knowledge graph, improving information retrieval and discovery.
