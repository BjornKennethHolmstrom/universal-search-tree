# Universal Search Tree (UST) Models: Documentation and Visualization

This document provides an overview of three Universal Search Tree (UST) model implementations, along with their visualizations.

## 1. Neural Network-Guided AdaptiveMultiUST

### Overview

The Neural Network-Guided AdaptiveMultiUST combines the adaptability of a Universal Search Tree (UST) with the learning capabilities of a neural network. This implementation uses a neural network to guide the restructuring process of the UST, potentially improving its efficiency over time.

### How It Works

1. **Tree Structure**: The core is an AdaptiveMultiUST, where each node represents a point in multi-dimensional space.
2. **Neural Network**: A simple neural network predicts optimal connections for nodes in the tree.
3. **Dynamic Restructuring**: As the tree is used and restructured, it collects data on node connections to train the neural network.
4. **Guided Optimization**: The neural network predicts the optimal number of connections for each dimension of a node during restructuring.
5. **Continuous Learning**: New training data is generated with each restructuring operation, allowing continuous improvement of predictions.

## 2. MultiUST-Enhanced Neural Network

### Overview

The MultiUST-Enhanced Neural Network integrates an Adaptive Multi-dimensional Universal Search Tree (AdaptiveMultiUST) into a neural network architecture. This implementation uses the UST as a preprocessing layer for the neural network, potentially improving the network's ability to handle complex, high-dimensional data.

### How It Works

1. **UST Layer**: A custom TensorFlow layer (USTLayer) incorporates an AdaptiveMultiUST.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The UST layer processes input data using the tree structure.
3. **Dynamic Weighting**: Processed data is weighted based on the nearest node's data and total input dimensions.
4. **Neural Network**: The processed and weighted data passes through standard neural network layers.
5. **End-to-End Training**: The entire model, including the UST layer, is trained end-to-end.

## 3. Hierarchical Neural-UST Model

### Overview

The Hierarchical Neural-UST Model combines multiple neural networks with an Adaptive Multi-dimensional Universal Search Tree (AdaptiveMultiUST). This implementation creates a dynamic, hierarchical structure where different neural networks are activated based on the input data's position in the multi-dimensional space.

### How It Works

1. **Multiple Subnets**: The model consists of multiple small neural networks (subnets), each responsible for a different region of the input space.
2. **UST for Subnet Selection**: An AdaptiveMultiUST organizes these subnets and selects which subnet to use for a given input.
3. **Dynamic Routing**: For each input, the UST finds the nearest node, corresponding to a specific subnet for processing.
4. **Independent Training**: Each subnet has its own optimizer and is trained independently on data in its region of the input space.
5. **Adaptive Structure**: As the UST adapts over time, the organization of subnets can change, potentially leading to a more efficient overall model.
