# Adaptive Multi-dimensional Universal Search Tree (AdaptiveMultiUST)

## Overview

The Adaptive Multi-dimensional Universal Search Tree (AdaptiveMultiUST) is an innovative data structure that combines the flexibility of graph-like connections with the efficiency of tree-based searches in multi-dimensional space. This structure is designed to adapt its connections based on access patterns, potentially optimizing itself for specific use cases over time.

## Key Features

1. **Multi-dimensional Data**: Each node in the AdaptiveMultiUST represents a point in n-dimensional space.
2. **Flexible Connections**: Nodes can connect to multiple other nodes in each dimension.
3. **Adaptive Structure**: The tree restructures itself based on access patterns, potentially improving search efficiency over time.
4. **Nearest Neighbor Search**: Efficiently finds the nearest node to a given point in multi-dimensional space.

## Implementation Details

### MultiDimNode

The `MultiDimNode` class represents a node in the AdaptiveMultiUST:

- `coords`: Numpy array representing the node's coordinates in n-dimensional space.
- `data`: Additional data associated with the node.
- `connections`: Dictionary mapping dimensions to lists of connected nodes.
- `access_count`: Counter for tracking how often the node is accessed.

### AdaptiveMultiUST

The `AdaptiveMultiUST` class manages the overall structure:

- `dimensions`: Number of dimensions in the space.
- `nodes`: List of all nodes in the structure.
- `access_threshold`: Threshold for triggering restructuring.

Key methods:
- `add_node`: Adds a new node to the structure and connects it to nearest neighbors.
- `find_nearest`: Finds the nearest node to given coordinates.
- `_restructure`: Adapts the structure by modifying connections based on access patterns.

## Usage Example

```python
ust = AdaptiveMultiUST(dimensions=3)
ust.add_node([1, 2, 3], "A")
ust.add_node([4, 5, 6], "B")
ust.add_node([7, 8, 9], "C")

nearest, path = ust.find_nearest([3, 4, 5])
print(f"Nearest node to [3, 4, 5]: {nearest.data}")
print(f"Path: {[node.data for node in path]}")
```

## Potential Applications

1. **Spatial Databases**: Efficient querying of multi-dimensional spatial data.
2. **Recommendation Systems**: Representing items or users in multi-dimensional feature space.
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying similar patterns in high-dimensional data.
4. **Time Series Analysis**: Representing time series data with multiple attributes.
5. **Adaptive Machine Learning Models**: As a base for models that adapt to changing data distributions.

## Future Directions

1. Optimization of the restructuring algorithm for better adaptability.
2. Implementation of range queries and other complex search operations.
3. Visualization tools for better understanding of the structure's behavior.
4. Parallelization for handling large-scale datasets.
5. Theoretical analysis of time and space complexity under various conditions.

## Conclusion

The AdaptiveMultiUST represents a novel approach to handling multi-dimensional data with an adaptive structure. While still in its early stages, this concept shows promise for applications requiring efficient searches in high-dimensional spaces with changing access patterns.
