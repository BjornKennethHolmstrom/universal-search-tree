# Hierarchical Neural-UST Model

## Overview

The Hierarchical Neural-UST Model is a novel approach that combines multiple neural networks with an Adaptive Multi-dimensional Universal Search Tree (AdaptiveMultiUST). This implementation creates a dynamic, hierarchical structure where different neural networks are activated based on the input data's position in the multi-dimensional space.

## How It Works

1. **Multiple Subnets**: The model consists of multiple small neural networks (subnets), each responsible for a different region of the input space.

2. **UST for Subnet Selection**: An AdaptiveMultiUST is used to organize these subnets in a multi-dimensional space and select which subnet to use for a given input.

3. **Dynamic Routing**: For each input, the UST finds the nearest node, which corresponds to a specific subnet. This subnet is then used to process the input.

4. **Independent Training**: Each subnet has its own optimizer and is trained independently on the data that falls into its region of the input space.

5. **Adaptive Structure**: As the UST adapts its structure over time, the organization of the subnets in the input space can change, potentially leading to a more efficient overall model.

## Key Components

- `HierarchicalNeuralUST`: The main class that integrates the UST with multiple neural networks.
- `call`: Selects and uses the appropriate subnet for a given input.
- `train_step`: Performs a training step on the selected subnet.
- `compute_loss` and `compute_gradients`: Helper methods for the training process.

## Usage

The model is used similarly to a standard neural network. During both training and inference, the UST is used to select the appropriate subnet for each input. This allows different parts of the model to specialize in different regions of the input space.

This approach aims to create a more flexible and adaptive model that can efficiently handle complex, non-uniform data distributions by leveraging both the structuring capabilities of the UST and the learning power of neural networks.

## Visualization

To best visualize the Hierarchical Neural-UST Model, consider the following approaches:

1. **UST and Subnet Mapping**:
   - Create a 3D scatter plot where each point represents a subnet.
   - Color code points based on their specialization or performance.
   - Draw connections between nearby subnets to represent the UST structure.

2. **Dynamic Routing Visualization**:
   - Animate the path of input data through the UST to its corresponding subnet.
   - Use heatmaps to show the activation patterns of different subnets for various inputs.

3. **Performance Landscape**:
   - Create a contour plot or 3D surface plot showing how performance varies across the input space.
   - Highlight regions where different subnets are active.

Example visualization code snippet for UST and subnet mapping:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

def visualize_subnets(model):
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
    
    for i, node in enumerate(model.ust.nodes.values()):
        ax.scatter(node.coords[0], node.coords[1], node.coords[2], 
                   c=f'C{i}', s=100, label=f'Subnet {i}')
    
    ax.set_xlabel('X')
    ax.set_ylabel('Y')
    ax.set_zlabel('Z')
    ax.legend()
    plt.title("Hierarchical Neural-UST Subnet Mapping")
    plt.show()
```

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Complex Robotic Control Systems**:
   - In advanced robotics where different control strategies are needed for different situations or environments.
   - Each subnet could specialize in a particular type of movement or environmental condition, with the UST efficiently routing control decisions.

2. **Adaptive Natural Language Processing**:
   - In multilingual or multi-domain NLP tasks.
   - Different subnets could specialize in different languages or domains, with the UST efficiently routing inputs to the most appropriate subnet.

3. **Multi-Scale Image Analysis**:
   - In satellite imagery analysis where features exist at multiple scales.
   - Different subnets could specialize in different scales or types of features, with the UST routing image patches to the appropriate subnet based on content.

4. **Personalized Recommendation Systems**:
   - In large-scale recommendation systems with diverse user bases.
   - Subnets could specialize in different user segments or product categories, with the UST efficiently routing users and items to the most relevant subnet for personalized recommendations.
